Hi! My name's Alexis (aka "Lexi"). As an Environmental Dynamics PhD candidate at the University of Arkansas, I have been building a portfolio of skills to meet the challenges wrought by climate change, land degradation, and environmental injustice. 

For my dissertation, I leverage open source data, remote sensing, bioinformatics, field work, and statistical modeling to better understand the drivers of biodiversity. To address the gap between theory and decision-making, I am also wielding social science to better understand the dynamics between people and nature. 

Throughout my academic and professional journey, Iâ€™ve focused on promoting engaged research, studying community-based environmental solutions, and evaluating scientific norms that affect how we monitor and assess ecosystems. My ultimate goals are to promote equitable and effective stewardship of our natural resources by empowering communities and equipping land managers with the necessary science.
