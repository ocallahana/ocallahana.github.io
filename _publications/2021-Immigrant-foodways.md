excerpt: 'This study explores the contemporary foodscape of Jersey City, New Jersey. Although Jersey City has a long history as a destination for immigrants from a wide range of countries, few studies exist concerning its rich array of ethnic foodways. Analysis of the diverse foodscape of Jersey City identifies risks to sovereignty such as the availability of culturally appropriate foods. The mixed methods research utilizes semi-structured surveys and freelists. The results demonstrate a strong, positive cognitive connection between immigrants and their traditional foodways, manifested in the popularity of fresh vegetables. Spatial representations of traditionally designated food deserts and the distribution of food stores suggest that the presence and roles of ethnic food stores should be more explicitly considered when constructing ideas about access to healthy food.'
